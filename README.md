# ðŸ“– About Me
Hello my name is Eduardo, welcome to my Github profile.

### What I am currently doing
I currently am pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. My short-term goal is to pass all the classes I am required to pass to complete my degree, but my long-term goal is to make connections and networking opportunities with many.
